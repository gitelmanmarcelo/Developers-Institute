// In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use (ie. let or const):

// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
let bankAmount = 0;

// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
const vat = 0.17;

// Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example : const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]

// Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses)
//  so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).

// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.

details.forEach( (item, index, details) => {
    details[index] *= (1+vat);
    console.log(details[index]);
    bankAmount += details[index];
});
console.log('---------------------------------');
console.log('Current amount: ' + bankAmount);
