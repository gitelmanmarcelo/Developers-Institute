Donate App.
First of all the idea of the project is wonderful, helpful and useful.
I think you did an excellent job with your code. Very good file structure with your controllers,modules ,routes and even a dotENV file!
I really like this project and you showed understanding of the learned subjects.
Creating a user, sending an email if there has been a donation. 
I like the stying as it fits the concept of the website very well.
Good job all around!!!
