Part I

Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.

A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
CREATE TABLE Customer(
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL)

The Customer profile table should have the 
columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)
CREATE TABLE Customer_profile(
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
isLoggedIn boolean DEFAULT false,
customer_id integer references Customer(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
)


Insert those customers

John, Doe
Jerome, Lalu
Lea, Rive

INSERT INTO Customer(first_name,last_name)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe'),
('Jerome', 'Lalu'),
('Lea', 'Rive')

Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries

John is loggedIn
Jerome is not logged in

INSERT INTO customer_profile(isLoggedIn, customer_id)
VALUES (TRUE,(SELECT id FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'John')),
(FALSE,(SELECT id FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'Jerome'))


Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
SELECT first_name FROM customer INNER JOIN customer_profile ON customer_profile.customer_id = customer.id
WHERE isLoggedIn

All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.
SELECT first_name, isLoggedIn FROM customer LEFT JOIN customer_profile 
ON customer_profile .customer_id = customer.id 

The number of customers that are not LoggedIn
SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM customer LEFT JOIN customer_profile 
ON customer_profile.customer_id = customer.id WHERE NOT isLoggedIn

Part II:

Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

CREATE TABLE book(
	book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, 
	author VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
)


Insert those books :
Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

INSERT INTO book(title,author)
VALUES ('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),
('Harry Potter', 'J.K Rowling'),
('To kill a mockingbird', 'Harper Lee')


Create a table named Student, with the columns : 
student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. 
Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

CREATE TABLE student(
	student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	age INTEGER CHECK (age <= 15) 
)

Insert those students:
John, 12
Lera, 11
Patrick, 10
Bob, 14

select * from student

INSERT INTO student(name, age)
VALUES ('John', 12),
('Lera', 11),
('Patrick', 10),
('Bob', 14)

Create a table named Library, with the columns :
book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
borrowed_date
CREATE TABLE library(
book_fk_id integer REFERENCES book(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
student_id integer REFERENCES student(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
borrowed_date DATE
)


This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables :
A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021

INSERT INTO library(book_fk_id,student_id,borrowed_date)
VALUES ((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title='Alice In Wonderland'),
	   (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name='John'), '20220215'),
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title='To kill a mockingbird'),
	   (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name='Bob'), '20210303'),
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title='Alice In Wonderland'),
	   (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name='Lera'), '20210523'),
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title='Harry Potter'),
	   (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name='Bob'), '20210812')
	   
Display the data
Select all the columns from the junction table
SELECT * FROM library

Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
SELECT name, title FROM book INNER JOIN library ON book.book_id = library.book_fk_id
INNER JOIN student ON student.student_id = library.student_id

Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland
SELECT AVG(age) FROM book INNER JOIN library ON book.book_id = library.book_fk_id
INNER JOIN student ON student.student_id = library.student_id WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland'

Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?
DELETE FROM student
WHERE name = 'Lera'

The respective record is deleted from the junction table as well
